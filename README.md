# Pokemon Weak Detector

Web Application to find pokemon that can beat your or your opponent's pokemon.

## Requirement

- Python 2+ Not 3
- SWI-Prolog
- pyswip
- flask
- Flask-Cors

## Structure
1. Knowledge Base  
  We use prolog as our logical programming tool to store the knowledgebase fact and rule of pokemon.

2. RESTful Api  
  I'm fuckin love Flask. This is framework from heaven!!!!!!!!!!!
  
3. Front-End  
  Vue.js serve the web page. Why Vue.js? Because "Last year is Angular Year, This year is React year" Next year might be Vue2 year!!!!

## API Guidline to use it

1. Simple do this in cmd.  
  ```
  python api.py
  ```

## Issue
Prolog is too damn difficult to find any answer so sad ;(
CORS in prolog is not good bad bad. Moreover Prolog+Django is difficult like hell. I don't know what's happen on Pyswip in that.
However I found Flask, this framework save my life.

Ahhhh I love it.

## Special Thank
Our data come from two of this, I don't any word more than "Thank you" for making our project finish. :D
